# scala-music
Scala Music is a tool to work with music using the Scala programming language.

A music can be created by using convenient methods contained in the _music.Music_ object. See the _example_ package
for some examples (you must provide a soundfont to use).
Alternatively, one can specify notes by providing absolute pitches and then convert them to pitches with _Types.pitch_.
This can be useful for algotithmic composition.
